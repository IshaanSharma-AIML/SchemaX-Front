# Pre-Deployment Code Review Summary

##  Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **SSR Compatibility Issue - FIXED** 
   - **File**: `frontend/src/hooks/useVoiceRecognition.js`
   - **Issue**: Direct access to `window.SpeechRecognition` without checking if `window` is defined
   - **Fix**: Added `typeof window !== 'undefined'` check before accessing browser APIs
   - **Impact**: Prevents SSR hydration errors during build

### 2. **Next.js Configuration - ENHANCED** 
   - **File**: `frontend/next.config.mjs`
   - **Enhancements**:
     - Added `reactStrictMode: true` for better development experience
     - Configured image optimization settings
     - Set proper trailing slash handling
   - **Impact**: Better performance and compatibility

### 3. **Amplify Configuration - CREATED** 
   - **File**: `frontend/amplify.yml`
   - **Features**:
     - Proper build commands for Next.js
     - Caching configuration for faster builds
     - Security headers for production
   - **Impact**: Optimized build process and security

##  Verified Working Correctly

### 1. **Environment Variables** 
   - All API URLs use `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` environment variable
   - Proper fallback to localhost for local development only
   - No hardcoded production URLs found
   - **Files checked**:
     - `frontend/src/lib/store/users-panel/auth/authSlice.js`
     - `frontend/src/lib/store/users-panel/chat/chatSlice.js`
     - `frontend/src/lib/store/users-panel/projects/projectSlice.js`

### 2. **Browser API Safety** 
   - All `localStorage` access is guarded with `typeof window !== 'undefined'`
   - All `document` access is in client components or useEffect hooks
   - Speech Recognition API properly checked for browser support
   - **Files verified**:
     - `frontend/src/lib/store/users-panel/auth/authSlice.js` 
     - `frontend/src/contexts/ThemeContext.js` 
     - `frontend/src/hooks/useTextToSpeech.js` 
     - `frontend/src/hooks/useVoiceRecognition.js`  (fixed)

### 3. **Client Component Directives** 
   - All components using browser APIs have `'use client'` directive
   - Redux store provider properly configured for client-side
   - **Files verified**:
     - `frontend/src/lib/store/StoreProvider.jsx` 
     - `frontend/src/contexts/ThemeContext.js` 
     - All page components using hooks 

### 4. **Dependencies** 
   - All required dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Next.js 15.3.3 compatible with React 19
   - No missing or deprecated packages found

### 5. **Build Configuration** 
   - `package.json` has correct build script: `"build": "next build"`
   - No custom build scripts that might conflict
   - TypeScript/JavaScript configuration is correct

## ⚠️ Notes and Recommendations

### Console Logs
- There are debug `console.log` statements in the code (especially in `chatSlice.js` and `page.jsx`)
- **Recommendation**: Consider removing or wrapping in `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development')` for production
- **Impact**: Low - won't break deployment, but reduces console noise in production

### Environment Variable Setup
- **CRITICAL**: You must set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` in AWS Amplify Console
- **Value**: Your backend API URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.com/api`)
- **Without this**: The app will default to `http://localhost:8000/api` which won't work in production

### CORS Configuration
- Ensure your backend API has CORS configured to allow requests from your Amplify domain
- Backend should accept requests from: `https://your-amplify-app.amplifyapp.com`

### Backend Deployment
- Make sure your backend is deployed and accessible before deploying frontend
- Test the backend API endpoints independently
- Verify JWT token generation and validation work correctly

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to AWS Amplify:

- [ ] Backend API is deployed and accessible
- [ ] Backend CORS is configured for Amplify domain
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` environment variable is set in Amplify Console
- [ ] All code changes are committed and pushed to Git
- [ ] Repository is connected to AWS Amplify
- [ ] Build settings are configured (should auto-detect from `amplify.yml`)
- [ ] Test the deployment in a staging branch first (recommended)

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

Your codebase is now ready for AWS Amplify deployment! All critical issues have been fixed:

1.  SSR compatibility issues resolved
2.  Environment variables properly configured
3.  Browser API access safely guarded
4.  Amplify configuration file created
